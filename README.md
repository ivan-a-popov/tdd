Trying TDD: django training project -- a simple to-do list

I made this project while reading Harry J.W. Percival's "Obey the Testing Goat! TDD for the Web, with Python, Selenium, Django, JavaScript and pals..."
As suggested by the Author, it wasn't just a "copy-paste" job -- I wrote every line of code manually in VIM.
Moreover I complicate my task using the latest version of Jango, Selenium, etc. against the ones used in the book.

I had a lot of fun going through. 
Many thanks to Harry who managed to publish the book online for everyone interested, and guys from Oâ€™Reilly Media, Inc., who allowed him to do so.
